dft

returns their earliest known ancestor â€“ the one at the farthest 
distance from the input individual. If there is more than one
ancestor tied for "earliest", return the one with the lowest 
numeric ID. If the input individual has no parents, the 
function should return -1.

P:
initiate graph
append all values into the graph vertex and then edges

run a dfs on the  graph and find the one looked for longest path
to input




e:
see file

r:
maybe add ifs in for loops when addign vertexs and edges to clean up and 
run less ie no redundant vertices added
